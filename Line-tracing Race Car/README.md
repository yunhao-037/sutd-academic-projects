**Line-tracing Race Car**

A group project with the course "System and Control" (Jan - Apr 2020).

Designed an autonomous control robot car that can traverse a closed-loop track by applying control theories.
Aimed to track through straight, bent, dotted lines and right-angle turns,
by using Arduino Romeo controller, light-dependent resisitor (LDR) and infrared reflectance line sensors.

Compiled the coding logic for directional control; pin outs are indicated in the .ino file.
