**"Dress Smart"**

A group project with the course "Engineering Design Innovation" (Jan - Apr 2020).

Designed an integrated solution (IoT) of closet and phone app to maximise the frequency of clothes worn that users currently own.
Aimed to help users organise and retrieve clothes easily while being able to stay stylish and environmental friendly (increase clothes usage by decrease buying frequencies).

Compiled the coding logic for the High Frequency (HF) RFID reader-tag system; Arduino Uno pin outs are indicated in the .ino file.
