**Climate controlled terrarium**

A group project with the course "Thermal Systems for Power and Environment" (Sep - Dec 2020).

Designed an automated terrarium able to regulate against ambient changes;
aimed to maintain a controlled environment with high humidity, constant range of temperature, proper illumination, and good ventilation.

I compiled the coding logic of the feedback control circuit of the terrarium.
Hardware used: temperature and humidity sensor; light dependent sensor; water atomisation module; LED strips; fans.
Control circuit connection diagram is attached as .png; Arduino Uno pin outs are indicated in the .ino file.
